    XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language 
    designed to store and transport data. 
    It is both human-readable and machine-readable. 
    XML allows users to define their own tags and the 
    structure of the document, making it highly flexible 
    for various applications such as data exchange, 
    configuration files, and more.
